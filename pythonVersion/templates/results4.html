        <p> <strong>Understanding the plot:</strong> <br />
        This plot displays the distribution of the number of recipes that users have reviewed and given ratings. <br />
        From this plot, we can see that most users gave reviews for well less than a 1000. However, there were a few <br />
        users who have given many reviews that are outside the norm.
